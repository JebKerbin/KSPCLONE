Here's a list of specific additional features to enhance your Roblox KSP-inspired game:

Gameplay and Progression:

Science System:
Implement a basic science system where Kerbals can perform experiments (e.g., surface samples, temperature readings) on different celestial bodies.
Award science points for successful experiments.
Use science points to unlock new parts or technologies.
Contracts:
Introduce a contract system with objectives like reaching a specific altitude, orbiting a planet, or landing on a moon.
Reward players with funds and science points for completing contracts.
Kerbal Experience:
Implement a system where Kerbals gain experience based on their missions.
Experienced Kerbals could have improved skills (e.g., better piloting, more efficient repairs).
Rescue Missions:
Generate rescue missions where players need to rescue stranded Kerbals from orbit or other planets.
Base Building (Limited):
Allow players to place simple base structures (e.g., flags, small habitats) on planetary surfaces.
Failure States:
Implement failure states, such as engine failures, fuel leaks, or structural failures.
Kerbals can repair certain failures during EVA.
Technical and Visual Enhancements:

Parallax Terrain:
Add parallax terrain effects to planetary surfaces for a more realistic sense of depth.
Particle Effects:
Implement particle effects for engine exhaust, atmospheric entry, and explosions.
Sound Effects:
Add sound effects for engines, explosions, atmospheric sounds, and UI interactions.
Camera Modes:
Implement multiple camera modes, including chase camera, orbital camera, and IVA (Internal View Activity) for command pods.
Re-entry Effects:
Add heat effects, and visual effects to show the spacecraft heating up during re-entry.
Staging Visuals:
When a stage is activated, add visual effects to show the separation of the parts.
Trajectory Prediction:
Show a predicted trajectory line, that changes in real time, based on player input.
Debug UI:
When in developer mode, show a debug UI, that shows the current velocity, position, and other useful information.
UI and Information:

Delta-v Calculations:
Display delta-v (change in velocity) information for the current stage and the entire spacecraft.
Resource Management:
Implement a detailed resource management UI showing fuel levels, electrical charge, and other resources.
Maneuver Node System(simplified):
Allow players to set maneuver nodes on their orbital path, to plan future burns.
Planet Information UI:
When the player clicks on a planet in the map view, display information about that planets gravity, atmosphere, and other useful data.
